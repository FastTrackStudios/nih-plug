//! Types and traits for REAPER's embedded/inline FX UI.
//!
//! This allows plugins to render a small inline UI directly in REAPER's track control panel (TCP)
//! or mixer control panel (MCP), without creating a separate window.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! Implement the [`EmbeddedEditor`] trait and return it from [`Plugin::embedded_editor()`].
//!
//! ```ignore
//! fn embedded_editor(&mut self) -> Option<Arc<dyn EmbeddedEditor>> {
//!     Some(Arc::new(MyEmbeddedEditor::new(self.params.clone())))
//! }
//! ```
